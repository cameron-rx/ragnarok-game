# Ragnarok
This is a simple 2D rogue-like game ,inspired by the likes of binding of isaac, that I created in my final year of sixth form. It features random seeded dungeon generation and is in a somewhat playable state though it would not take long to finish and there arent many enemies implemented and only one item.
Will look to return and remake this in C++ at a later date.
